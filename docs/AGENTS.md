This folder contains documentation:

[external/](./external/) -> Contains documentation intended to be user-facing to be displyaed on the documentation website.
[internal/](./internal/) -> Contains internal-only development documentation. This will contain items such as architecture, implementation plans, and other design docs.

-> If you need to come up with a design proposal, or outlining an implementation plan, put this in `internal/`, after reviewing existing files in `internal/` folder.

-> If you need to understand the interfaces and expected user usage, read documentation in the `external/` folder. ALWAYS ensure new or updated implementations align with user usage described in files in `internal/`.
