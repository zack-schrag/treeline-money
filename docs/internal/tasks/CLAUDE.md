This directory contains a list of tasks that have not been implemented yet, and are ready to be implemented.

# When picking up a task
- ALWAYS review the top-level CLAUDE.md file for implementation guidelines
- ALWAYS review PRFAQ.md for full project vision and context
- ALWAYS review docs/architecture.md for project structure and rules
- ALWAYS search for existing docs in both docs/external and docs/internal to understand existing context and architecture for the relevant task.
- If you are considering multiple options for implementation, input into the relevant tasks file with a new section "Open Questions".
- ALWAYS update relevant documentation. For example, if you are adding a new slash command or user-facing CLI, update the relevant documents in docs/external.
- Your final step should ALWAYS be to solicit feedback. Once the work is accepted, move into the "done/" folder and commit your changes.
