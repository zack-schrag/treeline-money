NOT READY FOR POWER SESSION YET

We want to create a new document in docs/external/guides called "inspiration.md". This will give users a bunch of ideas of things they can do with Treeline. Some ideas:
- Automate sending a weekly email to your spouse with summary
- Create marimo dashboard
- Run a cron job to run /sync every day
- Cron job to run AI ask every week with markdown summary sent as email
- pipe SQL output to chart command
