In analysis mode, the kyeboard shortcut has "Alt+enter" to execute query, but "alt" is not a key on a Macbook, for example. In the tag mode, there's shortcut that has a similar thing (alt vs opt), look at that.

There may be other shortcuts that need to be aligned as well, review them to make sure they are somewhat consistent (they can't be fully consistent, because they are different modes with different features), but common shortcuts should make sense.

Acceptance criteria:
- All keyboard shortcuts in the TUIs (especially analysis and tag mode) as consistent.
