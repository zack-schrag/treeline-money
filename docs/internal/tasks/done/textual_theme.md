We have a theme system currently, but separate from Textual's system. Let's unify ours with Textual's, so users can select it from the TUI settings dropdown.

Acceptance criteria:
- Users can select "treeline" theme from textual TUI dropdown and it's applied
- Textual theme system is prioritized over the scriptable commands - as this requires less theming. 
- End-users can provide custom themes to also use in Textual TUI
- Theme configurations are documented for end users in docs/external/guides/theme_configuration.md
