# Analysis Mode - Modal View Implementation

**Approach:** Full-screen modal view (like `/tag` mode)
**Proposal:** [analysis_mode_v2.md](../../proposals/analysis_mode_v2.md)

## Overview

Building an integrated workspace for fluid data exploration with:
- SQL editor (bottom panel, always visible)
- Results table (middle panel, scrollable)
- Chart display (top panel, conditional)
- Keyboard shortcuts (header, context-aware)

## Task Breakdown

1. ✅ **[01_build_analysis_layout.md](01_build_analysis_layout.md)** - Core modal view structure
2. ✅ **[02_sql_editor_panel.md](02_sql_editor_panel.md)** - Multiline SQL editor integration
3. ✅ **[03_results_panel.md](03_results_panel.md)** - Results table display and scrolling
4. ✅ **[04_chart_panel.md](04_chart_panel.md)** - Chart integration in top panel
5. ✅ **[05_keyboard_navigation.md](05_keyboard_navigation.md)** - Event loop and shortcuts
6. ⏭️ **[06_histogram_helper.md](06_histogram_helper.md)** - Smart histogram bucketing (SKIPPED - use DuckDB's histogram function instead)
7. ✅ **[07_polish_and_docs.md](07_polish_and_docs.md)** - Final touches and documentation
8. ✅ **[08_load_saved_items.md](08_load_saved_items.md)** - Load saved queries and charts (NEW)

## ⚠️ Architecture Guidelines

**CRITICAL:** This feature touches core CLI flows and adds a new modal view.

### Before Starting Each Task:
1. Review [docs/internal/architecture.md](../../architecture.md)
2. Identify which layer each component belongs to:
   - **CLI Layer**: `src/treeline/commands/analysis.py` - thin presentation, renders views
   - **Service Layer**: Use existing services (db_service, etc.)
   - **Domain Layer**: `AnalysisSession` dataclass for state
   - **Infrastructure**: No new infra needed, reuse existing

### After Completing Each Task:
**MANDATORY:** Use `architecture-guardian` agent to review architectural compliance

### Red Flags to Avoid:
❌ Business logic in `commands/analysis.py`
❌ Direct database calls from CLI
❌ Modal view code in service layer
❌ Global state or singletons

### Good Patterns:
✅ Thin command handler that delegates to services
✅ State as simple dataclass
✅ Rich Layout for UI (similar to tag mode)
✅ Dependency injection for services

## Dependencies

**Existing code to leverage:**
- `/tag` mode implementation - similar modal view patterns
- Multiline SQL editor - already exists in `/sql` command
- Chart wizard - already exists
- Query execution service - already exists

**New code needed:**
- `AnalysisSession` dataclass
- Layout composition with 3-4 panels
- Event loop for keyboard navigation
- Chart panel rendering

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- AnalysisSession state management
- Keyboard event routing logic
- Panel visibility based on state

**Smoke Tests:**
- Full analysis workflow: enter → type SQL → execute → chart → exit
- State persistence during session
- Reset functionality

## Success Criteria

- [x] User can enter `/analysis` and see full-screen modal view
- [x] SQL editor is always visible at bottom
- [x] Ctrl+Enter executes query and displays results
- [x] 'g' creates chart via in-TUI wizard
- [x] Tab switches focus between panels
- [x] 'v' toggles between results and chart view
- [x] 's' saves queries/charts with in-TUI prompt
- [x] 'r' resets results/chart
- [x] Ctrl+C exits cleanly
- [x] All context remains visible (no disappearing SQL/results)
- [x] 198 tests passing
- [x] '?' shows help overlay with all shortcuts
- [x] Documentation updated (help command, slash_commands.md, landing_page.md)
- [x] Load saved queries/charts functionality with auto-execute

## Timeline Estimate

- ✅ Task 01-02: 2 hours (layout + SQL editor) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Task 03: 2 hours (results panel with column windowing) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Task 04: 3 hours (chart integration with in-TUI wizard) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Task 05: 2 hours (keyboard nav with focus management + save) - COMPLETE
- ⏭️ Task 06: SKIPPED (use DuckDB histogram instead)
- ✅ Task 07: 2 hours (polish + docs) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Task 08: 3 hours (load saved items) - COMPLETE

**Original estimate: ~8-10 hours**
**Total actual time: ~14 hours**
**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**
