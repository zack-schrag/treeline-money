We have several TUIs:
- tag mode
- analysis mode
- queries
- charts

All of them feel disconnected, not a consistent look and feel.

Acceptance criteria:
- All TUI modes share common components
- All TUI modes have a consistent look and feel: visuals, themes, keyboard shortcuts, etc.
- Any future TUI modes can easily plug into the same visuals with little effort
- How to put future TUI modes into this sytem is documented in one the appopriate place in docs/external
