Currently, the pyplot code is all bundled in with this repo. This should be in it's own separate repo in ~/code/pyplot.

Acceptance criteria:
- The pyplot code is moved to a separate git project
- The pyplot code has things added to it to make it open source ready: MIT license, documentation (quickstart, reference, examples, etc.)
- If it's missing tests, add some simple unit tests, don't overcomplicate this though
