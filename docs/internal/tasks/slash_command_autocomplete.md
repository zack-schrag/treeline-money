Currently, the user has to fully type out slash commands in the REPL. Instead, it should autocomplete as soon as "/" is typed.

Acceptance critera:
- Slash commands are suggested instantly as user types "/" into the interactive REPL.
- This implementation should follow a similar UX to ./import_file_autocomplete.md. If this task is done first, update ./import_file_autocomplete.md with instructions on how to ensure a similar UX. If this task is done second, simply follow the pattern implemented by the other task.
