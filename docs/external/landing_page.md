You: What was my spending on dining last month?

AI: Based on your transactions, dining spending for
    October 2025 was $847.32.

    SQL used:
    SELECT SUM(amount) FROM transactions
    WHERE 'dining' = ANY(tags)
      AND transaction_date >= '2025-10-01'
      AND transaction_date < '2025-11-01'

## Why Treeline?

**AI-Powered Insights**
Ask questions in plain English. Get instant answers with SQL you can verify and iterate on.

**Your Data, Your Way**
Direct DuckDB access. Build custom dashboards. Export to Jupyter. Version control your analysis.

**Terminal-Native**
Keyboard-driven workflow. No context switching. Fast, focused, distraction-free.

**Truly Extensible**
Plugin marketplace for budgets, retirement planning, and custom workflows. Or build your own.

## Core Features

### 🤖 AI Chat
Ask questions naturally:
- "What were my top spending categories last month?"
- "Why was September more expensive than August?"
- "Show me my net worth trend over the last year"

The AI shows its work - every answer includes the SQL used. Learn, verify, and iterate.

### 📊 Chart Visualizations
Build terminal charts from any query. Save configurations. Create a dashboard that updates automatically.

Charts powered by PyPlot - beautiful Unicode visualizations optimized for terminal display.

### 🏷️ Smart Tagging
Tag transactions with AI assistance. Tag one transaction, and similar ones get suggested automatically.

**Tagging Power Mode** - Keyboard-driven rapid tagging. Process hundreds of transactions in minutes, not hours.

### 🔍 Interactive Analysis Workspace
A Jupyter-like environment for fluid data exploration:
- **Split-panel TUI** - SQL editor and results always visible
- **Live query execution** - See results instantly without leaving the editor
- **Integrated charting** - Create visualizations without context switching
- **Smart navigation** - Tab between panels, context-aware shortcuts
- **Saved queries** - Build and reuse your analysis templates

Think of it as an IDE for your financial data - everything you need in one focused workspace.

**Also available:** `treeline query` for quick one-off SQL queries, and `treeline charts` for browsing saved visualizations.

### 🔌 Plugin Ecosystem
Extend Treeline with plugins from the community:

**Simple Budget** - Traditional category-based budgeting built on Treeline's flexible tag system

**Retirement Planner** - Model scenarios and projections based on your actual financial data

**Alert System** - Get notified based on custom query thresholds (low balance, spending spikes, etc.)

Or build your own with:
- Custom schema extensions
- Lifecycle hooks
- Custom CLI commands
- Pre-built queries and dashboards

### 🔐 Privacy First
Your data lives on your computer, encrypted at rest and in transit. Direct file access means you can:
- Back up your data anywhere
- Use git for version control
- Script and automate with standard Unix tools
- Export to any format

**Even Treeline servers can't read your data.** End-to-end encryption means only you have the keys.

## Local-First Philosophy

Treeline feels more like a coding IDE than a traditional finance app:

```
~/.treeline/
├── treeline.db          # Your encrypted DuckDB database
├── queries/             # Saved SQL queries
│   ├── monthly_summary.sql
│   └── spending_trends.sql
├── charts/              # Chart configurations
│   ├── net_worth.tl
│   └── category_breakdown.tl
├── plugins/             # Installed plugins
└── config.toml          # Your preferences
```

Edit a saved query? Just open the file. Version control your financial analysis? `git init`. Build custom automation? Write a bash script.

**Your data is actually yours.**

## FAQ

**Do I need to know SQL?**
Not necessarily - the AI chat works great for most questions. But SQL gives you precision and power when you need it. The AI shows you the SQL it uses, so you can learn as you go.

**Why terminal/CLI?**
Personal finance analysis is iterative and dynamic - like coding. What works in 2025 might not work in 2027. We give you direct access to your data and get out of your way. Plus, terminal workflows are fast, keyboard-driven, and distraction-free.

**Can I use this for budgeting?**
Yes! Install the Simple Budget plugin from the marketplace. We believe tags are more flexible than rigid categories, but the plugin gives you traditional budgeting if you want it.

**How secure is my data?**
Your data lives on your machine, encrypted at rest and in transit. Cloud backups are end-to-end encrypted - even Treeline servers can't read your data. You can also export everything and keep it locally if you prefer.

**Is there a mobile app?**
Yes! The mobile app provides read-only access to your dashboards, charts, and AI assistant. Perfect for checking your finances on the go or sharing with a partner who doesn't use the CLI.

**Can I export my data?**
Absolutely. Your data lives in a DuckDB file you can access directly. Export to CSV, Parquet, JSON, or connect from Jupyter/Python. Use DBeaver or any SQL tool. It's your data.

**Can I automate things?**
Yes! Run Treeline commands in scripts. Build custom automation. Some users have built:
- Monthly expense reports emailed automatically
- Text alerts for specific transaction patterns
- Custom sync schedules
- Integration with home automation

**What about collaborative features?**
Pro tier includes shared access (great for couples). The mobile app lets non-technical users view your dashboards. For teams, contact us about custom solutions.

## Vision

We're building the most powerful personal finance tool for technical users. A tool that:

- Respects your intelligence (shows its work, gives you access)
- Respects your privacy (local-first, encrypted, exportable)
- Respects your workflow (terminal-native, scriptable, extensible)
- Grows with you (plugins, custom analysis, automation)

**Your financial data is too important to be locked in someone else's app.**
