# CLI Reference

Command | Description
`treeline` | Enter Treeline interactive mode

## Suggested Enhancements
- Enumerate primary CLI flags/subcommands (`treeline --path`, `treeline --version`, `treeline run <script>`) once they are defined so users can discover non-interactive workflows.
- Link each slash command to its dedicated help section and include usage examples to reinforce the coding-centric ergonomics.
